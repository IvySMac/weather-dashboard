# Weather Dashboard

## Description 
I created this exercise to have a better understanding of the fetch function and see just how useful server-side APIs can be when applied to a website. Server-side API's are powerful (and fun!) tools that can make a website useful in every-day life. 

## Usage

![A header that says 'Weather Dashboard' is at the top. There is a search bar to the left to input city names and in the middle shows today's weather forecast. Below today's weather forecast, there are five more sections displaying the weather for the next five days.]('')

A weather app is a handy tool to have when creating plans or getting ready for the day. This application will allow you to input a city of your choice and see the weather not only for the current day, but for the next five too. You'll get access to the temperature (in Fahrenheit), wind speed, and humidity.

## User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria 
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
